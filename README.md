# Global Input App Browser Extension

A powerful browser extension that transforms your mobile device into a secure controller for web applications. Available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/global-input-app/hcklienddlealndjnakkagefaelhnjkp) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/global-input-app/), this TypeScript-based React application leverages the [global-input-react] module to enable seamless mobile-to-desktop interactions.

## Overview
